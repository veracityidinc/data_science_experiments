### data_science_experiments
All data science projects during their exploratory phase will be presented here till these reach maturity to be incorporated into the main platform.

A certain management system will be put in place so as folks with small or no exposure to programming languages/packages therein used, be able to follow along.

#### A. Underwriting Scoring model 3rd iteration
The scope is to put together a statistical/machine learning model able to score a quote prior binding into policy, using information available @ the point of sale.

**Phase 1:** Put together as many dimensions of info known at the point of sale for any quote. 

**Why is this necessary?** The most important aspect of any model is the input. The more we know about a single quote the better. Besides the self apparent merits, this requirement implies that a significant effort is to be put around maintaining an as high dimensional as possible set of features for all policies.
Discovering yet another dimension of information for any policy, should be a permanent goal towards each everybody is wellcome to contribute. The very next thing is to figure out a way to compute it from raw data in a **perfect* way. Actually this is really important cause as the saying goes in mathematical modeling **garbage in, garbage out**.

**Results so far:**

  * Which MDA rules fired during the specific quotation period?
  * How many MDA rules fired duringt the specific quotation period?

**Feel free to contribute with ideas between the two following lines**
